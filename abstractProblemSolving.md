###Questions
>Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:
What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
What are the steps involved in tying a shoelace?
What are the steps involved in making a cup of coffee?
What are the steps involved in making a phone call?

Pick up phone → Dial phone number → Hold phone to ear → Listen & Talk

>In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem?

I would go back to the user click button click to see if the problem is there if not go back to user name input. 

>What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?
	
	Say Hi → User button click → User Name Input
	Look here first → still broken → narrowed down to this
>Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.
	Problem: Which freeway do I take this morning?
	Check how much time I have to get to work → Check GPS on phone to see traffic → Decide between H-1 or H-2 freeway → Drive following map on GPS
